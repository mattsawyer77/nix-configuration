* Can you write an emacs lisp function that checks if there is a file in the current directory called lcov.info. If the file exists and is newer than all of the go files in the current directory, then it will just enable cov-mode. If the file does not exist or it's older than any of the go files in the current directory, then it will simply call another elisp function, `sawyer/go-generate-test-coverage`.
