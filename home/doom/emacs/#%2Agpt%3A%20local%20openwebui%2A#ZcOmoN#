* Can you write an emacs lisp function that iterates over currently defined faces and changes any that are using a bold weight to a medium weight?


* Certainly! Here’s an Emacs Lisp function that iterates over all defined faces and sets their weight to =medium= if it’s currently =bold=:

#+begin_src elisp
(defun my/change-bold-faces-to-medium ()
  "Iterate over all faces and set those with bold weight to medium."
  (interactive)
  (dolist (face (face-list))
    (let ((current-weight (face-attribute face :weight nil t)))
      (when (eq current-weight 'bold)
        (set-face-attribute face nil :weight 'medium)))))
#+end_src

- Run with =M-x my/change-bold-faces-to-medium=.
- It checks each face’s weight, and updates if it’s bold.  
- Add to your init file if you want it on startup.
