* Can you write an emacs lisp function that uses the emacs consult package to find protobuf message definitions? The function should have the following 2 inputs: the proto message name, and a list of one or more root directories. The function should embed the message name into a regex like `^message\s+%s\b` (where ~%s~ is the message name), and recursively search the given root directories (.proto files only).
